                1. Sun Tzu said:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>The art of war is of vital importance to the State.</code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either
                to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry
                which can on no account be neglected.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant
                factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations,
                when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. These are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>(1) The Moral Law;</li>
                <li>(2) Heaven;</li>
                <li>(3) Earth;</li>
                <li>(4) The Commander;</li>
                <li>(5) Method and discipline.</li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <p>
                5,6. The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete
                accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him
                regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat,
                times and seasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. Earth comprises distances, great and small;
                danger and security; open ground and narrow passes;
            </p>
            <p>
                9. The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom,
                sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.
            </p>
            <p>
                10. By method and discipline are to be understood
                the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions,
                the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance
                of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the
                control of military expenditure.
            </p>
            <p>
                11. These five heads should be familiar to every general:
                he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them
                not will fail.
            </p>
            <p>
                12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking
                to determine the military conditions, let them be made
                the basis of a comparison, in this wise:
            </p>
            <p>13.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued
                    with the Moral law?</li>
                <li>(2) Which of the two generals has most ability?</li>
                <li>(3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven
                    and Earth?</li>
                <li>(4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?</li>
                <li>(5) Which army is stronger?</li>
                <li>(6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?</li>
                <li>(7) In which army is there the greater constancy
                both in reward and punishment?</li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <p>
                14. By means of these seven considerations I can
                forecast victory or defeat.
            </p>
            <p>
                15. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts
                upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command!
                The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it,
                will suffer defeat: let such a one be dismissed!
            </p>
            <p>
                16. While heading the profit of my counsel,
                avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances
                over and beyond the ordinary rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                17. According as circumstances are favorable,
                one should modify one's plans.
            </p>
            <p>
                18. All warfare is based on deception.
            </p>
            <p>
                19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable;
                when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we
                are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away;
                when far away, we must make him believe we are near.
            </p>
            <p>
                20. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder,
                and crush him.
            </p>
            <p>21. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him.
                If he is in superior strength, evade him.
            </p>
            <p>
                22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to
                irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.
            </p>
            <p>
                23. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.
                If his forces are united, separate them.
            </p>
            <p>
                24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where
                you are not expected.
            </p>
            <p>
                25. These military devices, leading to victory,
                must not be divulged beforehand.
            </p>
            <p>
                26. Now the general who wins a battle makes many
                calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought.
                The general who loses a battle makes but few
                calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations
                lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat:
                how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention
                to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.
            </p>

            <header>II. Waging War</header>
            <p>
                1. Sun Tzu said:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front,including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.</code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                2. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory
                is long in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and
                their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town,
                you will exhaust your strength.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources
                of the State will not be equal to the strain.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped,
                your strength exhausted and your treasure spent,
                other chieftains will spring up to take advantage
                of your extremity. Then no man, however wise,
                will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war,
                cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. There is no instance of a country having benefited
                from prolonged warfare.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted
                with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand
                the profitable way of carrying it on.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy,
                neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.
            </p>
            <p>
                9. Bring war material with you from home, but forage
                on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough
                for its needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                10. Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army
                to be maintained by contributions from a distance.
                Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes
                the people to be impoverished.
            </p>
            <p>
                11. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes
                prices to go up; and high prices cause the people's
                substance to be drained away.
            </p>
            <p>
                12. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry
                will be afflicted by heavy exactions.
                13,14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion
                of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare,
                and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated;
                while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses,
                breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields,
                protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons,
                will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.
            </p>
            <p>
                15. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging
                on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy's provisions
                is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise
                a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty
                from one's own store.
            </p>
            <p>
                16. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must
                be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from
                defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.
            </p>
            <p>
                17. Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots
                have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first.
                Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy,
                and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours.
                The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.
            </p>
            <p>
                18. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment
                one's own strength.
            </p>
            <p>
                19. In war, then, let your great object be victory,
                not lengthy campaigns.
            </p>
            <p>
                20. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies
                is the arbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it
                depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.

            <p>
                1. Sun Tzu said:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.</code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles
                is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists
                in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to
                balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent
                the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in
                order is to attack the enemy's army in the field;
                and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it
                can possibly be avoided. The preparation of mantlets,
                movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take
                up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over
                against the walls will take three months more.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. The general, unable to control his irritation,
                will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants,
                with the result that one-third of his men are slain,
                while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous
                effects of a siege.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's
                troops without any fighting; he captures their cities
                without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom
                without lengthy operations in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery
                of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph
                will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten
                to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one,
                to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army
                into two.
            </p>
            <p>
                9. If equally matched, we can offer battle;
                if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy;
                if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.
            </p>
            <p>
                10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made
                by a small force, in the end it must be captured
                by the larger force.
            </p>
            <p>
                11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State;
                if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will
                be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will
                be weak.
            </p>
            <p>
                12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring
                misfortune upon his army:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    13. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat,
                    being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey.
                    This is called hobbling the army.
                </li>
                <li>
                    14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the
                    same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant
                    of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes
                    restlessness in the soldier's minds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    15. (3) By employing the officers of his army
                    without discrimination, through ignorance of the
                    military principle of adaptation to circumstances.
                    This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.
                </li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <p>
                16. But when the army is restless and distrustful,
                trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes.
                This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging
                victory away.
            </p>
            <p>
                17. Thus we may know that there are five essentials
                for victory:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when
                    not to fight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior
                    and inferior forces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same
                    spirit throughout all its ranks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take
                    the enemy unprepared.
                </li>
                <li>
                    (5) He will win who has military capacity and is
                    not interfered with by the sovereign.
                </li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <p>
                18. Hence the saying: 
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.</code>
            </pre>

            <header>IV. Tactical Dispositions</header>
            <p>
                1. Sun Tzu said:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.</code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our
                own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy
                is provided by the enemy himself.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat,
                but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer
                without being able to do it.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics;
                ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient
                strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. The general who is skilled in defense hides in the
                most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in
                attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven.
                Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves;
                on the other, a victory that is complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. To see victory only when it is within the ken
                of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.
            </p>
            <p>
                9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight
                and conquer and the whole Empire says, "Well done!"
            </p>
            <p>
                10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength;
                to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight;
                to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.
            </p>
            <p>
                11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is
                one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.
            </p>
            <p>
                12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation
                for wisdom nor credit for courage.
            </p>
            <p>
                13. He wins his battles by making no mistakes.
                Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty
                of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is
                already defeated.
            </p>
            <p>
                14. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into
                a position which makes defeat impossible, and does
                not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.
            </p>
            <p>
                15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist
                only seeks battle after the victory has been won,
                whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights
                and afterwards looks for victory.
            </p>
            <p>
                16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law,
                and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is
                in his power to control success.
            </p>
            <p>
                17. In respect of military method, we have,
                firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity;
                thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances;
                fifthly, Victory.
            </p>
            <p>
                18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth;
                Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to
                Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation;
                and Victory to Balancing of chances.
            </p>
            <p>
                19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as
                a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.
            </p>
            <p>
                20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting
                of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.
            </p>

            <header>V. Energy</header>
            <p>
                1. Sun Tzu said:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.</code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                2. Fighting with a large army under your command
                is nowise different from fighting with a small one:
                it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. To ensure that your whole host may withstand
                the brunt of the enemy's attack and remain unshakenâ€”
                this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone
                dashed against an eggâ€”this is effected by the science
                of weak points and strong.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used
                for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed
                in order to secure victory.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible
                as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams;
                like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew;
                like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. There are not more than five musical notes,
                yet the combinations of these five give rise to more
                melodies than can ever be heard.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. There are not more than five primary colors
                (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination
                they produce more hues than can ever been seen.
            </p>
            <p>
                9. There are not more than five cardinal tastes
                (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations
                of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.
            </p>
            <p>
                10. In battle, there are not more than two methods
                of attackâ€”the direct and the indirect; yet these two
                in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.
            </p>
            <p>
                11. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn.
                It is like moving in a circleâ€”you never come to an end.
                Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?
            </p>
            <p>
                12. The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent
                which will even roll stones along in its course.
            </p>
            <p>
                13. The quality of decision is like the well-timed
                swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy
                its victim.
            </p>
            <p>
                14. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible
                in his onset, and prompt in his decision.
            </p>
            <p>
                15. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow;
                decision, to the releasing of a trigger.
            </p>
            <p>
                16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may
                be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all;
                amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head
                or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.
            </p>
            <p>
                17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline,
                simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness
                postulates strength.
            </p>
            <p>
                18. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is
                simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under
                a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy;
                masking strength with weakness is to be effected
                by tactical dispositions.
            </p>
            <p>
                19. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy
                on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to
                which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something,
                that the enemy may snatch at it.
            </p>
            <p>
                20. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march;
                then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.
            </p>
            <p>
                21. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined
                energy, and does not require too much from individuals.
                Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize
                combined energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                22. When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting
                men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones.
                For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain
                motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope;
                if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if
                round-shaped, to go rolling down.
            </p>
            <p>
                23. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men
                is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain
                thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject
                of energy.

            <p>
                1. Sun Tzu said:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.</code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on
                the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy
                to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage,
                he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;
                if well supplied with food, he can starve him out;
                if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend;
                march swiftly to places where you are not expected.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. An army may march great distances without distress,
                if it marches through country where the enemy is not.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks
                if you only attack places which are undefended.You can
                ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold
                positions that cannot be attacked.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. Hence that general is skillful in attack whose
                opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful
                in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                9. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you
                we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible;
                and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.
            </p>
            <p>
                10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible,
                if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire
                and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid
                than those of the enemy.
            </p>
            <p>
                11. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced
                to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high
                rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack
                some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.
            </p>
            <p>
                12. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent
                the enemy from engaging us even though the lines
                of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground.
                All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable
                in his way.
            </p>
            <p>
                13. By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining
                invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated,
                while the enemy's must be divided.
            </p>
            <p>
                14. We can form a single united body, while the
                enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will
                be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole,
                which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.
            </p>
            <p>
                15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force
                with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.
            </p>
            <p>
                16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be
                made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare
                against a possible attack at several different points;
                and his forces being thus distributed in many directions,
                the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will
                be proportionately few.
            </p>
            <p>
                17. For should the enemy strengthen his van,
                he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear,
                he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left,
                he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right,
                he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere,
                he will everywhere be weak.
            </p>
            <p>
                18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare
                against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling
                our adversary to make these preparations against us.
            </p>
            <p>
                19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle,
                we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order
                to fight.
            </p>
            <p>
                20. But if neither time nor place be known,
                then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right,
                the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van
                unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van.
                How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are
                anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest
                are separated by several LI!
            </p>
            <p>
                21. Though according to my estimate the soldiers
                of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage
                them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then
                that victory can be achieved.
            </p>
            <p>
                22. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may
                prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover
                his plans and the likelihood of their success.
            </p>
            <p>
                23. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his
                activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself,
                so as to find out his vulnerable spots.
            </p>
            <p>
                24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own,
                so that you may know where strength is superabundant
                and where it is deficient.
            </p>
            <p>
                25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch
                you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions,
                and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies,
                from the machinations of the wisest brains.
            </p>
            <p>
                26. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's
                own tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.
            </p>
            <p>
                27. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer,
                but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory
                is evolved.
            </p>
            <p>
                28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained
                you one victory, but let your methods be regulated
                by the infinite variety of circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
                29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its
                natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong
                and to strike at what is weak.
            </p>
            <p>
                31. Water shapes its course according to the nature
                of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works
                out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.
            </p>
            <p>
                32. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape,
                so in warfare there are no constant conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                33. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his
                opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called
                a heaven-born captain.
            </p>
            <p>
                34. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth)
                are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make
                way for each other in turn. There are short days and long;
                the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.

            <header>VII. Maneuvering</header>
            <p>
                1. Sun Tzu said:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.</code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                2. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces,
                he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof
                before pitching his camp.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. After that, comes tactical maneuvering,
                than which there is nothing more difficult.
                The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists
                in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route,
                after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting
                after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him,
                shows knowledge of the artifice of DEVIATION.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Maneuvering with an army is advantageous;
                with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order
                to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be
                too late. On the other hand, to detach a flying column
                for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage
                and stores.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their
                buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day
                or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch,
                doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage,
                the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into
                the hands of the enemy.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded
                ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth
                of your army will reach its destination.
            </p>
            <p>
                9. If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver
                the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division,
                and only half your force will reach the goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                10. If you march thirty LI with the same object,
                two-thirds of your army will arrive.
            </p>
            <p>
                11. We may take it then that an army without its
                baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost;
                without bases of supply it is lost.
            </p>
            <p>
                12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are
                acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.
            </p>
            <p>
                13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march
                unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its
                mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices,
                its marshes and swamps.
            </p>
            <p>
                14. We shall be unable to turn natural advantage
                to account unless we make use of local guides.
            </p>
            <p>
                15. In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
                16. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops,
                must be decided by circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
                17. Let your rapidity be that of the wind,
                your compactness that of the forest.
            </p>
            <p>
                18. In raiding and plundering be like fire,
                is immovability like a mountain.
            </p>
            <p>
                19. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night,
                and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.
            </p>
            <p>
                20. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be
                divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory,
                cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.
            </p>
            <p>
                21. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.
            </p>
            <p>
                22. He will conquer who has learnt the artifice
                of deviation. Such is the art of maneuvering.
            </p>
            <p>
                23. The Book of Army Management says: On the field
                of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough:
                hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary
                objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution
                of banners and flags.
            </p>
            <p>
                24. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means
                whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused
                on one particular point.
            </p>
            <p>
                25. The host thus forming a single united body,
                is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone,
                or for the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art
                of handling large masses of men.
            </p>
            <p>
                26. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires
                and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners,
                as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.
            </p>
            <p>
                27. A whole army may be robbed of its spirit;
                a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                28. Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning;
                by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening,
                his mind is bent only on returning to camp.
            </p>
            <p>
                29. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when
                its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish
                and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.
            </p>
            <p>
                30. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance
                of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:--this is the art
                of retaining self-possession.
            </p>
            <p>
                31. To be near the goal while the enemy is still
                far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is
                toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy
                is famished:--this is the art of husbanding one's strength.
            </p>
            <p>
                32. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose
                banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking
                an army drawn up in calm and confident array:--this
                is the art of studying circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
                33. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill
                against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.
            </p>
            <p>
                34. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight;
                do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.
            </p>
            <p>
                35. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy.
                Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.
            </p>
            <p>
                36. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free.
                Do not press a desperate foe too hard.
            </p>
            <p>
                37. Such is the art of warfare.

            <header>VIII. Variation in Tactics</header>
            <p>
                1. Sun Tzu said:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces</code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                2. When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country
                where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies.
                Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions.
                In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem.
                In desperate position, you must fight.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. There are roads which must not be followed,
                armies which must be not attacked, towns which must
                be besieged, positions which must not be contested,
                commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages
                that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle
                his troops.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. The general who does not understand these, may be well
                acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he
                will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art
                of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted
                with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use
                of his men.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of
                advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in
                this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential
                part of our schemes.
            </p>
            <p>
                9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties
                we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate
                ourselves from misfortune.
            </p>
            <p>
                10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage
                on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them
                constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements,
                and make them rush to any given point.
            </p>
            <p>
                11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the
                likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness
                to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking,
                but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.
            </p>
            <p>
                12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect
                a general:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction;
                </li>
                <li>
                    (2) cowardice, which leads to capture;
                </li>
                <li>
                    (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;
                </li>
                <li>
                    (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame;
                </li>
                <li>
                    (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him
                    to worry and trouble.
                </li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <p>
                13. These are the five besetting sins of a general,
                ruinous to the conduct of war.
            </p>
            <p>
                14. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain,
                the cause will surely be found among these five
                dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation.

            <header>IX. The Army on The March</header>
            <p>
                1. Sun Tzu said:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.</code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                2. Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb
                heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. After crossing a river, you should get far away
                from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. When an invading force crosses a river in its
                onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream.
                It will be best to let half the army get across,
                and then deliver your attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go
                to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing
                the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy.
                So much for river warfare.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern
                should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should
                have water and grass near you, and get your back
                to a clump of trees. So much for operations in salt-marches.
            </p>
            <p>
                9. In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible
                position with rising ground to your right and on your rear,
                so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind.
                So much for campaigning in flat country.
            </p>
            <p>
                10. These are the four useful branches of military
                knowledge which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish
                four several sovereigns.
            </p>
            <p>
                11. All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny
                places to dark.
            </p>
            <p>
                12. If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard
                ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind,
                and this will spell victory.
            </p>
            <p>
                13. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the
                sunny side, with the slope on your right rear.
                Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers
                and utilize the natural advantages of the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                14. When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country,
                a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked
                with foam, you must wait until it subsides.
            </p>
            <p>
                15. Country in which there are precipitous cliffs
                with torrents running between, deep natural hollows,
                confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires and crevasses,
                should be left with all possible speed and not approached.
            </p>
            <p>
                16. While we keep away from such places, we should
                get the enemy to approach them; while we face them,
                we should let the enemy have them on his rear.
            </p>
            <p>
                17. If in the neighborhood of your camp there should
                be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass,
                hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick
                undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched;
                for these are places where men in ambush or insidious
                spies are likely to be lurking.
            </p>
            <p>
                18. When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet,
                he is relying on the natural strength of his position.
            </p>
            <p>
                19. When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle,
                he is anxious for the other side to advance.
            </p>
            <p>
                20. If his place of encampment is easy of access,
                he is tendering a bait.
            </p>
            <p>
                21. Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the
                enemy is advancing. The appearance of a number of screens
                in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.
            </p>
            <p>
                22. The rising of birds in their flight is the sign
                of an ambuscade. Startled beasts indicate that a sudden
                attack is coming.
            </p>
            <p>
                23. When there is dust rising in a high column,
                it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low,
                but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach
                of infantry. When it branches out in different directions,
                it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood.
                A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army
                is encamping.
            </p>
            <p>
                24. Humble words and increased preparations are signs
                that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language
                and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he
                will retreat.
            </p>
            <p>
                25. When the light chariots come out first and take
                up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy
                is forming for battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                26. Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant
                indicate a plot.
            </p>
            <p>
                27. When there is much running about and the soldiers
                fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.
            </p>
            <p>
                28. When some are seen advancing and some retreating,
                it is a lure.
            </p>
            <p>
                29. When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears,
                they are faint from want of food.
            </p>
            <p>
                30. If those who are sent to draw water begin
                by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.
            </p>
            <p>
                31. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and
                makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.
            </p>
            <p>
                32. If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied.
                Clamor by night betokens nervousness.
            </p>
            <p>
                33. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's
                authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted
                about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry,
                it means that the men are weary.
            </p>
            <p>
                34. When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills
                its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their
                cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they
                will not return to their tents, you may know that they
                are determined to fight to the death.
            </p>
            <p>
                35. The sight of men whispering together in small
                knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection
                amongst the rank and file.
            </p>
            <p>
                36. Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is
                at the end of his resources; too many punishments betray
                a condition of dire distress.
            </p>
            <p>
                37. To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright
                at the enemy's numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
                38. When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths,
                it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.
            </p>
            <p>
                39. If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain
                facing ours for a long time without either joining
                battle or taking themselves off again, the situation
                is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.
            </p>
            <p>
                40. If our troops are no more in number than the enemy,
                that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack
                can be made. What we can do is simply to concentrate all
                our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy,
                and obtain reinforcements.
            </p>
            <p>
                41. He who exercises no forethought but makes light
                of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.
            </p>
            <p>
                42. If soldiers are punished before they have grown
                attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and,
                unless submissive, then will be practically useless.
                If, when the soldiers have become attached to you,
                punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless.
            </p>
            <p>
                43. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first
                instance with humanity, but kept under control by means
                of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory.
            </p>
            <p>
                44. If in training soldiers commands are habitually
                enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not,
                its discipline will be bad.
            </p>
            <p>
                45. If a general shows confidence in his men but always
                insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.

                1. Sun Tzu said:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: (1) Accessible ground; (2) entangling ground; (3) temporizing ground; (4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a great distance from the enemy.</code>

                1. Sun Tzu said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain,
                to wit: (1) Accessible ground; (2) entangling ground;
                (3) temporizing ground; (4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous
                heights; (6) positions at a great distance from the enemy.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides
                is called accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. With regard to ground of this nature, be before
                the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots,
                and carefully guard your line of supplies. Then you
                will be able to fight with advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Ground which can be abandoned but is hard
                to re-occupy is called entangling.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. From a position of this sort, if the enemy
                is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him.
                But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you
                fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible,
                disaster will ensue.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. When the position is such that neither side will gain
                by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. In a position of this sort, even though the enemy
                should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable
                not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing
                the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has
                come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy
                them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await
                the advent of the enemy.
            </p>
            <p>
                9. Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass,
                do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned,
                but only if it is weakly garrisoned.
            </p>
            <p>
                10. With regard to precipitous heights, if you are
                beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the
                raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.
            </p>
            <p>
                11. If the enemy has occupied them before you,
                do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.
            </p>
            <p>
                12. If you are situated at a great distance from
                the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal,
                it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be
                to your disadvantage.
            </p>
            <p>
                13. These six are the principles connected with Earth.
                The general who has attained a responsible post must be
                careful to study them.
            </p>
            <p>
                14. Now an army is exposed to six several calamities,
                not arising from natural causes, but from faults
                for which the general is responsible. These are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    (1) Flight;
                </li>
                <li>
                    (2) insubordination;
                </li>
                <li>
                    (3) collapse;
                </li>
                <li>
                    (4) ruin;
                </li>
                <li>
                    (5) disorganization;
                </li>
                <li>
                    (6) rout.
                </li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <p>
                15. Other conditions being equal, if one force is
                hurled against another ten times its size, the result
                will be the flight of the former.
            </p>
            <p>
                16. When the common soldiers are too strong and
                their officers too weak, the result is insubordination.
                When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers
                too weak, the result is collapse.
            </p>
            <p>
                17. When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate,
                and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account
                from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief
                can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight,
                the result is ruin.
            </p>
            <p>
                18. When the general is weak and without authority;
                when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there
                are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men,
                and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner,
                the result is utter disorganization.
            </p>
            <p>
                19. When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's
                strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one,
                or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one,
                and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank,
                the result must be rout.
            </p>
            <p>
                20. These are six ways of courting defeat, which must
                be carefully noted by the general who has attained
                a responsible post.
            </p>
            <p>
                21. The natural formation of the country is the soldier's
                best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary,
                of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly
                calculating difficulties, dangers and distances,
                constitutes the test of a great general.
            </p>
            <p>
                22. He who knows these things, and in fighting puts
                his knowledge into practice, will win his battles.
                He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely
                be defeated.
            </p>
            <p>
                23. If fighting is sure to result in victory,
                then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it;
                if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not
                fight even at the ruler's bidding.
            </p>
            <p>
                24. The general who advances without coveting fame
                and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only
                thought is to protect his country and do good service
                for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.
            </p>
            <p>
                25. Regard your soldiers as your children, and they
                will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them
                as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you
                even unto death.
            </p>
            <p>
                26. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make
                your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce
                your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder:
                then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children;
                they are useless for any practical purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                27. If we know that our own men are in a condition
                to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open
                to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.
            </p>
            <p>
                28. If we know that the enemy is open to attack,
                but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition
                to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.
            </p>
            <p>
                29. If we know that the enemy is open to attack,
                and also know that our men are in a condition to attack,
                but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes
                fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway
                towards victory.
            </p>
            <p>
                30. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion,
                is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never
                at a loss.
            </p>
            <p>
                31. Hence the saying: 
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.</code>
            </pre>
            <br>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="XI._The_Nine_Situations">
            <header>XI. The Nine Situations</header>
            <p>
                1. Sun Tzu said:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>he art of war is of vital importance to the State.</code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either
                to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry
                which can on no account be neglected.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant
                factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations,
                when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. These are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>(1) The Moral Law;</li>
                <li>(2) Heaven;</li>
                <li>(3) Earth;</li>
                <li>(4) The Commander;</li>
                <li>(5) Method and discipline.</li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <p>
                5,6. The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete
                accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him
                regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat,
                times and seasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. Earth comprises distances, great and small;
                danger and security; open ground and narrow passes;
            </p>
            <p>
                9. The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom,
                sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.
            </p>
            <p>
                10. By method and discipline are to be understood
                the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions,
                the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance
                of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the
                control of military expenditure.
            </p>
            <p>
                11. These five heads should be familiar to every general:
                he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them
                not will fail.
            </p>
            <p>
                12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking
                to determine the military conditions, let them be made
                the basis of a comparison, in this wise:
            </p>
            <p>13.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued
                    with the Moral law?</li>
                <li>(2) Which of the two generals has most ability?</li>
                <li>(3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven
                    and Earth?</li>
                <li>(4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?</li>
                <li>(5) Which army is stronger?</li>
                <li>(6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?</li>
                <li>(7) In which army is there the greater constancy
                both in reward and punishment?</li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <p>14. By means of these seven considerations I can
                forecast victory or defeat.
            </p>
            <p>15. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts
                upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command!
                The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it,
                will suffer defeat: let such a one be dismissed!
            </p>
            <p>16. While heading the profit of my counsel,
                avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances
                over and beyond the ordinary rules.
            </p>
            <p>17. According as circumstances are favorable,
                one should modify one's plans.
            </p>
            <p>18. All warfare is based on deception.

            </p>
            <p>
                19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable;
                when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we
                are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away;
                when far away, we must make him believe we are near.
            </p>
            <p>20. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder,
                and crush him.
            </p>
            <p>21. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him.
                If he is in superior strength, evade him.
            </p>
            <p>22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to
                irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.
            </p>
            <p>23. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.
                If his forces are united, separate them.
            </p>
            <p>
                24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where
                you are not expected.
            </p>
            <p>25. These military devices, leading to victory,
                must not be divulged beforehand.
            </p>
            <p>26. Now the general who wins a battle makes many
                calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought.
                The general who loses a battle makes but few
                calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations
                lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat:
                how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention
                to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.

                2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either
                to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry
                which can on no account be neglected.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant
                factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations,
                when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. These are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>(1) The Moral Law;</li>
                <li>(2) Heaven;</li>
                <li>(3) Earth;</li>
                <li>(4) The Commander;</li>
                <li>(5) Method and discipline.</li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <p>
                5,6. The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete
                accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him
                regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat,
                times and seasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. Earth comprises distances, great and small;
                danger and security; open ground and narrow passes;
            </p>
            <p>
                9. The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom,
                sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.
            </p>
            <p>
                10. By method and discipline are to be understood
                the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions,
                the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance
                of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the
                control of military expenditure.
            </p>
            <p>
                11. These five heads should be familiar to every general:
                he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them
                not will fail.
            </p>
            <p>
                12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking
                to determine the military conditions, let them be made
                the basis of a comparison, in this wise:
            </p>
            <p>13.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued
                    with the Moral law?</li>
                <li>(2) Which of the two generals has most ability?</li>
                <li>(3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven
                    and Earth?</li>
                <li>(4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?</li>
                <li>(5) Which army is stronger?</li>
                <li>(6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?</li>
                <li>(7) In which army is there the greater constancy
                both in reward and punishment?</li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <p>14. By means of these seven considerations I can
                forecast victory or defeat.
            </p>
            <p>15. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts
                upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command!
                The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it,
                will suffer defeat: let such a one be dismissed!
            </p>
            <p>16. While heading the profit of my counsel,
                avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances
                over and beyond the ordinary rules.
            </p>
            <p>17. According as circumstances are favorable,
                one should modify one's plans.
            </p>
            <p>18. All warfare is based on deception.

            </p>
            <p>
                19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable;
                when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we
                are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away;
                when far away, we must make him believe we are near.
            </p>
            <p>20. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder,
                and crush him.
            </p>
            <p>21. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him.
                If he is in superior strength, evade him.
            </p>
            <p>22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to
                irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.
            </p>
            <p>23. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.
                If his forces are united, separate them.
            </p>
            <p>
                24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where
                you are not expected.
            </p>
            <p>25. These military devices, leading to victory,
                must not be divulged beforehand.
            </p>
            <p>26. Now the general who wins a battle makes many
                calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought.
                The general who loses a battle makes but few
                calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations
                lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat:
                how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention
                to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.
